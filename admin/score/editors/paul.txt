Ok, here you are.  If you need more explanation, let me know. We are expecting a snow storm here on the East Coast, so I expect to be around all day. We could Skype, if that would be more effective.

1. Use "block" paragraph formatting -- no indents. Consistency is next to godliness.
# Normally I would agree, but in this case this indentation is customary for professional publications; LaTeX does it intentionally - I'm not going to consider it an error.

2. When you list a number of points, use numbers or "bullets" -- makes them stand out better.
# Where is this a problem? Did I miss an enumeration?

3. Look for "run-on" sentences, where there is more than one thought in a sentence. Break into two sentences. This problem is pervasive, and a standard problem with student writing.
# Pointing out some of these would be wonderfully helpful.

4. Pages need to be numbered -- typically at the bottom in a footer. I am not familiar with TeX, but I believe that is possible.  A quick look at the TeX file seems to show pretty conventional scripting techniques (like HTML, for instance).
# Sorry! I can't believe I accidentally turned numbering off. I've added nice footers and headers.

5. Beware of jargon. Keep your audience in mind. Do not assume that they are familiar with the technical terms that you have used. I had to look up a lot of stuff. If some longer discussion is needed on some fine point, move it to an appendix. The use of "deliverable" is such an example. Use of a verb as a noun is frowned upon. Or, a noun as a verb, for example, "disrespect." They are like finger nails on a blackboard....
# A list of these would be good; it's hard for me to tell what's jargon and what's not while I'm reading due to my familiarity with the jargon. 

6. The first paragraph of the "Problem Statement" is unreadable. I have no idea what you said. Incomplete and run-on sentences.
# I rewrote this; I hope it's more intelligible now.

7. Good use of numbered points in the scenarios. Just what I had in mind in #2 above. Outline format is a good idea... easy to follow just what takes place.

8. Again, the first paragraph in #3 Requirements: Specification suffers from incomplete sentences, etc., etc.  A re-write for clarity is important here. You must quickly explain the point to the reader, or their mind turns to oatmeal...
# Duly noted. Sabba may be rewriting this entire section, so I haven't touched it yet for this iteration.

9. Put some information on Django in an appendix. Ditto for explanations of the software tools that you use. A couple of links would be nice. I had to look up Django in Google.
# Ah, a great idea. Would links in a footer on the page be more useful, or would a link in the appendix along with an explanation be better?

10. Why was Python the language of choice?  I know. You know, but does your reader know? You might not even mention the issue at all?
# Is there somewhere we addressed this? I don't think the choice bears mentioning - Python is not specifically suited to this problem space. ("R" is a language that, by contrast, is specifically suited to statistics. Python is very general purpose.) I feel like a technical reader will know that Python is general purpose, and a non-programmer won't care why we picked Python.

11. Art (anything not text) is good, but it comes off a little "fuzzy" on my screen. Not sure what you want to do here.
# I'd like to get rid of our diagrams. They're too small to fit well into the PDF and I didn't feel like they were very helpful, even when clear. They're really an internal tool.

12. After Figure #1, you state "Once one...." This is awkward. The sentence doesn't make sense. Rewrite. Look for similar problems in the manuscript.
# Sabba's hopefully rewriting this section.

13. Problem with "thats" -- you mean "that is."  Avoid contractions, hyphenations, and abbreviations whenever possible. However, if you use something like NASA, explain it once, then use NASA from there on in. Consistency....

14. Explain the symbols at the top of Figure #2. Are they from an Egyptian tomb? <grin>  Nordic runes?  Unknown language from an extinct tribe in Mongolia?
# Yep. Getting rid of the diagrams.

15. You attribute human properties (Anthropomorphism) to Django. Hmm..... What does Django eat? Rare, or well done undergraduates??
# Pointing out places that we do this would help speed up our editing process.

16. List following Figure #5 seems funny???
# Yeah, that's technically my fault; the way LaTeX puts images inline is a little strange and I gave up due to time constraints, hoping to fix it later.

17. Anthropomorphism rears its head again on the first sentence in 4.2. Say it differently.

18. I like your narrative about how the project progressed. Don't be so hard on yourselves! Did you do a group Skype?  If everybody is local, it seems to work well. When I had a three-way conversation between Wales, Delaware, and California once, I found it worked best if the guy in the middle (me) hosted the session.

19. Is the word "backend" or "back end"?? I think the later. HTML5 is pretty cool. Jolicloud uses that, by my understanding.
# Backend and back end are used interchangably. I'll go with back end for consistency.

20. On page 29, you get around to discussing why you used Django. Maybe that might come earlier, as it is crucial to the success of the project. Just my thought.

21. Numbers less than 10 (and often less than 100) when used in text are spelled out. I notice this in your "lessons learned."

Overall conclusion... good report, with a few minor edits and you are good to go!  Let me see the final results, perhaps!
