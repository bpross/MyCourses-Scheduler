Validation and Verification

Our test framework for our implementation has three forms. Testing for the algorithm, testing for the web UI and testing the database through django. The testing for the algorithm is done by scripts, and the
web UI testing is done through a software suite and testing django is done through django's testing suite.

The algorithm was first tested by running the algorithm and then manually checking the
output. The output was checked to see if the proposed schedule was a valid schedule
and to see if all of the contraints were met. This became very tedious for large class
schedules, so a script was written that validates the output based on the constraints
given in the database. This allowed large testing to be completed much faster.

The web UI testing is done using a framework called Selenium. This open source tool
allows automatic testing of the web ui. Two methods were used for writing tests for the web
UI. Selenium has an IDE that allows you to record an interaction with the web UI and
run that recording as a test. This was done for basic actions, such as logging in and
out. The other way are python scripts that use Seleniums built in libraries to interact
with the web interface. This allows the tester to check for output on a given page and to
perform more complex actions. This was done for advanced actions, such as signing up for
classes, or adding students to the database.


Django's testing is done through tests.py. Django's test suit can test the framework with and other utilities. The testing suite is split into two different sections; doctests and unit tests. The tests are run through pythons manager, it can test the entire framwork, or specific modules of it. Our project used the unit test portion of the test suite to test the database and the database to algorithm connection.
