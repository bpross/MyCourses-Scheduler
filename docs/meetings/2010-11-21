Agenda:
- Unit testing
- Inspection
- Project status

Discussion Summary:
4:00-4:10 We'll be unit testing the algorithm and its modules.

4:10-4:15 According to Justin, running the algorithm from a command-line will be acceptable for our Acceptance Test. (We'd like to get a lot more done than that.)

4:15-4:25 Reviewing test material.

4:25-4:35 More unit test discussion.
- Will is taking a database unit test.
- Justin is doing a unit test for the course object's integrity and validity.
- Sabba is doing a unit test for the room object's integrity and validity.
- Erik is doing a unit test for the professor object's integrity and validity.
- Ben may do a unit test for the interface between django and the algorithm.

4:35-4:40 Project status
- Sabba, UI:
Over break, Sabba's going to modify what UI we have to template format, or rework the whole thing if possible.
- Justin, Documentation:
Design docs are finished. Class diagrams need work, but may need to wait on Django since it can generate them. Also, will work on docs for acceptance and unit tests.
- Erik, Module integration:
Gotta start working on integrating everything with Django.
- Erik, for Ben:
Algorithm's pretty much done; just gotta test everything.
- Will, Django:
Login is done; signup is done (see admin interface); waiting on templates for some functionality, like interfaces for the modules. Database design is done and needs to be implemented. Need to add roles to the user database.

4:40-4:45 UI Design
Will explained the templating system to Sabba, and explained what the difference between each role ought to be in implementation.

4:45 Inspection
We got contact with Ben; we'll be going over schedule.py, hopefully tomorrow

4:45-4:50
Went over database diagrams with Erik
