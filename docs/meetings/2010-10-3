Discussion Summary:
We'll have a server-client model. In the beginning, the server will process all data on its side and send HTML/CSS output to a web interface. The server will have two parts - the Django software stack, and a MySQL data store.

We would like to talk with the registrar regarding how they determine their schedule.

Will printed the deliverable.
