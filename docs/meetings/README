Project meeting notes go in this directory.

"Each project deliverable must be accompanied by a group time recording log and group meeting notes. Include in these notes: agenda of meeting, members present, discussion summary, time of meeting, location of meeting, members' roles (moderator, notetaker, time keeper) during meeting, action items to be worked on for next time and people responsible for them. This is worth 10% of each deliverable."
