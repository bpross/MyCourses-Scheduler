Coding Style

For this project, we'll be borrowing a significant portion of 
Python's style guide (PEP 0008).
PEP 0008 can be found at 
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Note that we will be ignoring the section on Version Bookkeeping.

Any Python code should conform to this style guide as well as
possible.

We will also be using Django's design philosophy.
Django's design philosophy can be found at 
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/

Most notable is the DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself when
ever possible. Additionally, spaghetti code should be avoided as
much as possible.




Performance

The scheduling algorithm shall run in no worse than O(n^n) time.
All other operations in the system, except starting the server,
should take negligible amounts of time. Negligible here is
defined as an absolute maximum of 1 second.

Note that DNS resolution and HTTP transport are not within the
scope of this requirements document; slow interaction with the
interface over the internet may be a symptom of a poor
connection.
