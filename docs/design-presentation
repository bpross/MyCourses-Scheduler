OVERVIEW

Slide 1: Name of project
Slide 2: Recap of project
Slide 3: High level architecture

High-level architecture: list pieces of software and have a sketch of how things work together.
Data storage: MySQL
Network protocol: HTTP
Servers: user-selected (we're not "in the cloud")
Major processes: Django (user interaction), call to external algorithm program

In depth: algorithm? Can we have an "in depth" look at the algorithm by Friday?

Same goes for interesting design problems.

Network communication protocols will all be handled by the software we're using.

One thread per request to the server.

Possible project risks: the only real risk is getting the algorithm wrong, or not finding one that's suitable.

Most project complexity is the algorithm itself, and making the UI pretty.
