                <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                <p>The Blue Bell system is an employee scheduling system that automates and reduces the manual labor of scheduling work shifts. We seek to provide small- to medium-sized businesses an easy-to-use and automated service that can help reduce the time and effort it takes to establish their work schedules.
</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<p>The Blue Bell team started in mid September by a group of 5 engineering students taking a software methodology course. Following the software engineering process, we chose to do a course scheduling system as our class project because, like many other students and faculty, we felt that there were problems and issues with our current course student portal and we believe that we could develop a better one. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>
The management of the Blue Bell team includes Justin Lazaro, Will Crawford, Ben Ross, Erik Steggall, and Sabba Petri. Several of the team members have held a variety of roles in the technology industry experience in roles such as IT, QA, and Marketing at top technology firms including: Hewlett Packard, RiverBed Technologies, and Yahoo!.</p> 
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>
While we are still in the very early stages of development, we believe that our solution can provide incredible value to businesses and ease the frustrations of faculty, students, and staff. We plan to offer our employee scheduling system as a service to businesses nationwide. </p>
